# Powerful AI - Dario Amodei

## A Country of Geniuses in a Datacenter

- Pure intelligence 
	- it is smarter than a Nobel Prize winner across most relevant field
- All interface
	- text, audio, video, mouse, keyboard control and internet access etc
- Long task
	- it can be given tasks that hours, days or weeks to complete
	- asking for clarification as nesessary

## The Marginal Returns to Intelligence

- Speed of the outside world
- Need for data
- Intrinsic complexity
- Contraints for humans
- Physical laws

## Compressed 21st Century

the idea that after powerful AI is developed, 
we will in a few years make all the progress that we would have made in the whole 21st century.

## Latency
there’s an unavoidable constant delay

## Work and Meaning
- Short terms
	- As long as AI is only better at 90% of a given job, the other 10% will cause humans to become highly leveraged, increasing compensation and in fact creating a bunch of new human jobs complementing and amplifying what AI is good at, such that the “10%” [expands to continue to employ almost everyone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy).
	- Even if AI can do 100% of things better than humans, but it remains inefficient or expensive at some tasks, or if the resource _inputs_ to humans and AI’s are meaningfully different, then the logic of comparative advantage continues to apply.
- Long Term
	- some new and stranger thing will be needed, and that it’s something no one today has done a good job of envisioning.
