# Thoughts on Behavioral Characteristics and Risk Management

## Current Challenges
- High proactivity in technical fields is a **strength**, but carries the risk of making decisions without sufficient consideration
- Insufficient distinction between one-way doors and two-way doors in decision making
- Tendency to not feel pain while profits are being generated, and only take action after losses occur
- **Case Study**: Bybit Hacking - Loss of approximately 1 million yen due to holding XRP and ETH

## Psychological Factors
- **Loss Aversion**: The psychological characteristic of feeling losses about twice as strongly as gains
- **Sunk Cost Bias**: Short-term pain (such as fees) inhibits important risk avoidance actions
  - I agree with this. The most important thing is to take risk avoidance action on the day.
  - However, I didn't act because some people said "hacking is a buying opportunity."
  - As a result, I experienced FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out).

## Improvement Approaches

### 1. Classification of Decisions
- Always ask yourself, "Can this be reversed later?" before making a decision
- Establish a rule to contemplate for at least 10 minutes if reversal is impossible

### 2. Risk Visualization
- Visualize "the worst-case scenario if no action is taken" with specific numbers
- Set an acceptable loss limit

### 3. Rule-based Judgment
- Establish rules such as "Act immediately if fees and losses are within 5%"
- Make judgments based on rules, not emotions

### 4. Regular Reviews
- Make monthly reviews a habit
- Identify small concerns or overlooked issues

## Implementation Method
- Set clear response rules for risk events in advance
- Utilize the **strength** of initiative while improving the quality of judgment
