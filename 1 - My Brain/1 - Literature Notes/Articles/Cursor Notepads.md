This content seems very useful for additional learning about naming conventions and design documents.

## Overview

Notepads in Cursor are advanced reference documents that enhance context-sharing between composers and chat, surpassing `.cursorrules` by enabling reusable contexts for development.

Notepads serve as collections of thoughts, rules, and documentation that can be:

- Shared between different parts of your development environment
- Referenced using the `@` syntax
- Enhanced with file attachments
- Used as dynamic templates for various development scenarios

## Getting started

1. Click the ”+” button in the Notepads section
2. Give your notepad a meaningful name
3. Add your content, context, files and other relevant information the same way you would in composer or chat.
4. Reference it in composers or chat using `@`

## Key features

- **Context Sharing**: Seamlessly share context between composers and chat
- **File Attachments**: Attach documentation and reference files (not possible in `.cursorrules`)
- **Dynamic References**: Use `@` mentions to link to other resources
- **Flexible Content**: Write and structure information in a way that suits your needs

## Common use cases

1. **Dynamic Boilerplate Generation**

- Create templates for common code patterns
- Store project-specific scaffolding rules
- Maintain consistent code structure across your team
2. **Architecture Documentation**

- Frontend specifications
- Backend design patterns
- Data model documentation
- System architecture guidelines
3. **Development Guidelines**

- Coding standards
- Project-specific rules
- Best practices
- Team conventions
