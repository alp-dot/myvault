# Pytest Test Discovery and Collection Mechanism

Pytest has a sophisticated test discovery and collection mechanism that allows for flexible and powerful test organization. Understanding these rules helps you structure your test suite effectively.

## 1. Test File Naming Conventions

Pytest identifies test files based on specific naming patterns:
- Files must be named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`
- Examples:
  - `test_user_authentication.py`
  - `login_test.py`
  - `test_database_operations.py`

**Key Points:**
- Test files should be located in the same directory as the code being tested or in its subdirectories
- This naming convention helps pytest automatically identify potential test files

## 2. Test Function and Method Naming

Pytest recognizes test functions and methods through specific naming rules:
- Functions must start with `test_`
- Test classes must start with `Test` (with some exceptions)

**Examples:**
```python
def test_user_login():
    assert authenticate_user('username', 'password') == True

class TestUserAuthentication:
    def test_invalid_login(self):
        assert authenticate_user('wrong', 'credentials') == False
```

**Exceptions:**
- Test classes inheriting from `unittest.TestCase` do not need to follow the `Test` prefix rule

## 3. Directory and Package Structure

Pytest has specific rules for recognizing test packages and configurations:
- Directories with `__init__.py` are recognized as packages
- Test files within these packages are collected
- `conftest.py` is a special file for:
  - Defining fixtures
  - Configuring test settings
  - Can be placed in the test directory or parent directories

## 4. Command-Line Options for Test Selection

Pytest provides powerful command-line options to control test execution:
- `-k EXPRESSION`: Run tests matching a specific keyword
  - Example: `pytest -k "login or authentication"`
- `-m MARKER`: Run tests with specific markers
  - Useful for categorizing tests (e.g., slow, fast, integration)
- `-x`: Stop test execution after the first failure
- `--tb=short`: Provide shorter traceback for easier debugging

## 5. Plugin Ecosystem

Pytest's extensibility is a key strength:
- Plugins can modify test collection and execution
- Extend functionality beyond default behaviors
- Examples of popular plugins:
  - `pytest-cov`: Code coverage reporting
  - `pytest-mock`: Enhanced mocking capabilities
  - `pytest-xdist`: Parallel test execution
