> When refactoring code collaboratively with an AI, using prompts that clearly articulate the following points is effective:
> 
> * **Clearly state the goal:**
>     * Communicate the specific objective you aim to achieve.
>     * Example: "After adding this feature, I want to improve the code's readability and maintainability. I'd like to consolidate duplicated logic and unify naming conventions."
> 
> * **Share the current situation:**
>     * Describe the issues with the current code or the areas you wish to improve.
>     * Example: "In the current code, the view function has become bloated, so I'm considering separating templates or introducing helper functions."
> 
> * **Indicate constraints and priorities:**
>     * Add any conditions or aspects that should be prioritized during the refactoring process.
>     * Example: "I want to prioritize improving code clarity while maintaining performance."
> 

When reviewing PRs using CodeRabbit, etc., please point out the items that you should refactor.
