# How to Make Takoyaki at Home

## Important Points

### Oil Amount
- Use generous amount of oil
- Especially important to use more oil at the beginning (to prevent sticking)

### Heat Control
- Use medium heat on the portable gas stove

### Seasoning
- Store-bought batter mix tends to be bland, especially when using too much cabbage
- Season with white dashi sauce
- Adjust flavor with MSG (Ajinomoto)

### Cooking Tips
- Rotating takoyaki balls is essential
- Using a spoon makes the rotation process easier
