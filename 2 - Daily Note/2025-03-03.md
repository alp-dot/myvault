# Reflections on Behavioral Characteristics and Risk Management

## Current Challenges
- While having **strengths** in high initiative in technical areas, there is a risk of making decisions without deep consideration
- Insufficient discernment between one-way doors and two-way doors
- Tendency to not feel pain when profits are being made, and only take action after losses occur
- **Case Study**: Bybit Hacking - Approximately 1 million yen loss from keeping XRP

## Psychological Factors
- **Loss Aversion**: Psychological characteristic of feeling losses about twice as strongly as gains
- **Sunk Cost Bias**: Short-term pain (such as fees) inhibits important risk-avoidance actions

## Improvement Approaches

### 1. Decision Classification
- Always ask yourself "Can this be reversed later?" before making decisions
- If reversal is unlikely, establish a rule to deliberate for at least 10 minutes

### 2. Risk Visualization
- Visualize the "worst-case scenario if no action is taken" with concrete numbers
- Set acceptable loss limits

### 3. Rule-Based Judgment
- Establish rules such as "Take immediate action if fees and losses are within 5%"
- Make judgments based on rules rather than emotions

### 4. Regular Reviews
- Make monthly reviews a habit
- Identify small concerns or matters being neglected

## Implementation Methods
- Set clear response rules for risk events in advance
- Leverage the **strength** of initiative while improving the quality of judgment
