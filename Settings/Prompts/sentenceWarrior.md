Follow the instructions below exactly in your reply.

# Purpose
Convert the given Japanese sentences (multiple lines)
into a flash-card format for rapid sentence-building practice.

# Output format
For **each** input line, output the following block **in that exact order**,
with no blank lines between blocks:

START
sentence-warrior
Japanese: <original Japanese sentence>
English: <natural, idiomatic English translation>
KeyPoint: <ONE concise point to remember—word, phrase, or syntax>
<!--ID: 1745461265105-->
END

# Detailed guidelines
- The **English** may be colloquial or written, but must sound natural to native speakers.
- In **KeyPoint**, give ONE memorable takeaway, e.g.  
  - “phrasal verb ‘pick up’”  
  - “replace the subject with *it* for emphasis”  
  - “since + past tense to give a reason”
- Do **NOT** alter the tokens “START”, “END”, or “sentence-warrior”, nor the line breaks.
- If an abbreviation or proper noun is unclear, write “[???]” instead of guessing, and give a brief note in KeyPoint.
- Output only the mixed Japanese/English blocks—no extra comments, numbering, or explanations.
- Ignore completely empty input lines.
